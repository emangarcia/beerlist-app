    "description": "Offering a luscious blend of flavor and drinkability, this Hop Experience Ale features ample additions of sticky, lupulin-packed hops, grown in the Pacific Northwest. The result is an aromatic blast of citrus, tropical fruit, and dank herb that transitions into resinous hop flavor and a delightfully balanced finish.",

Sweetish base malt, slightly biscuity. Good balance on this one. The malts are slightly sweet, but help the hop come through, especially the grapefruit, which assets itself more on the palate than on the nose. Finish is balanced - alcohol noticeable but not assertive.",

Itâ€™s golden to copper in color with a complex malt profile that will not overshadow the hops. Our flagship, RPM IPA, will satisfy any opinionated hop forward IPA consumer.",
